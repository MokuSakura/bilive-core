# Bilive-core

## Abstract

This is a core library for Bilive. Aiming at providing an easy-to-use interface for receiving danmaku from bilibili live
stream.

It's my first time to try an open-source project. If you have any advices, please tell me. It will be a great honor of
mine to have the chance to cooperate with others.

*This project is not finished yet*

The interface of this project is not stable and will constantly be updated until the version comes to 1.0
